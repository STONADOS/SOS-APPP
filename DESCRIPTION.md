What's the story : 

OKay, this application can make a change in most of the rural as well as in many urban places.....
Every year there are humongous rate of crimes and some of them are so horrifying and terrifying that even 
it does not feel like reading or listening it......

So atleast, I cn contribute by applying what I learnt as a developer to bring down the crime rate...

Also dedicated towards the ones in need

So I want to make a application which can help us by:

==> Sending our latitude-longitude to any one among the list of option provided, which includes:
1)Police Department
2)Nearest Hospitals
3)Fire Department
4)NGOs
5)Disaster Management Service

==> The user will have this application with (One Time Login) and every other time they use this application 
they will be auto logged in....

==> The database will get alerted and will get updated whenever the emergency button will be pressed....

Steps of the Design:

==> The application will be consisting of a drop down menu in which there will be the option in which
we will be able to see the time, date and position when the emergency button was last pressed....

==> There will be two button one is SOS which sends the emergency request to everyone
in the list......

==> The another button will redirect us the option menu in which we will have options to select to whom we have to send the emergency request.....
